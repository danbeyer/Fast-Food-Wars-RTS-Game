Fast Food Wars was created as a collaborative project as part of the computer science degree program at Oregon State University. The aim was to build a game using modern standard web technologies, relying primarily on javasript and HTML5 to create and manage the game world and objects, initialize the server on which the game runs, and provide a means to store saved progress via web cookies.

Further information on the development team, as well as instructions on running and playing the game, can be found in the pdf titled "Hydra".
